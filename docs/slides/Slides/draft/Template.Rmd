# Introduction  `r I(hexes(c("openintro")))`

.pull-left[
* _R has cutting edge models_. 
  
  Machine learning developers in some domains use R as their primary computing environment and their work often results in R packages.


* _It is easy to port or link to other applications_. 

  R doesn't try to be everything to everyone. If you prefer models implemented in C, C++, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `python`, `stan`, or `Weka`, you can access these applications without leaving R. 
]

.pull-right[
* _R and R packages are built by people who **do** data analysis_. 

* _The S language is very mature_. 

* The machine learning environment in R is extremely rich.

# Downsides to Modeling in R


.pull-left[
* R is a data analysis language and is not C or Java. If a high performance deployment is required, R can be treated like a prototyping language.  

* R is mostly memory-bound. There are plenty of exceptions to this though. 
]

.pull-right[
The main issue is one of _consistency of interface_. For example: 
* There are two methods for specifying what terms are in a model<sup>1</sup>. Not all models have both. 
* 99% of model functions automatically generate dummy variables. 
* Sparse matrices can be used (unless they can't).

# Syntax for Computing Predicted Class Probabilities

|Function     |Package      |Code                                                 |
|:------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|`lda`        |`MASS`       |`predict(obj)`                                       |
|`glm`        |`stats`      |`predict(obj, type = "response")`                    |
|`gbm`        |`gbm`        |`predict(obj, type = "response", n.trees)`           |
|`mda`        |`mda`        |`predict(obj, type = "posterior")`                   |
|`rpart`      |`rpart`      |`predict(obj, type = "prob")`                        |

|`logitboost` |`LogitBoost` |`predict(obj, type = "raw", nIter)`                  |
|`pamr.train` |`pamr`       |`pamr.predict(obj, type = "posterior", threshold)`   |

We'll see a solution for this later in the class.
