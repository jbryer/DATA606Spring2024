## Final Exam

* Will be available at 9:30pm.

* Due by end of day December 13th.

* You may use your book and course materials.

* I expect you to complete the exam on your own (i.e. do not discuss with classmates, colleagues, significant others, etc.)

* There are two parts:
	1. Part one multiple choice questions and short answer questions.
	2. Part two has a small data set to analyze with R, then answer some interpretation questions.

* Put your answers in the Rmarkdown file and submit the PDF file. **Please do not post your answers online!**

## My Work

My statistical research interest is in propensity score methods. Propensity score analysis (PSA) is a quasi-experimental design used to estimate causality from observational studies. It is generally conducted in two phases:

1. Estimate propensity scores (i.e. probability of being in the treatment) using the observed covariates.

		a. Check balance
		b. Re-estimate propensity scores

2. Estimate effect sizes using typical group differences (e.g. t-tests)

See my [Github repository](https://github.com/jbryer/psa) or [Intro to PSA slides](http://epsy887.bryer.org/slides/Intro_PSA.html). Also the PSA Shiny application:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
psa::psa_shiny()
```

Areas I have worked on:

* Multilevel PSA (see [`multilevelPSA`](http://jason.bryer.org/multilevelPSA) R package)
* Matching with non-binary treatments (see [`TriMatch`](http://jason.bryer.org/TriMatch) R package)
* Bootstrapping PSA (see [`PSAboot`](http://jason.bryer.org/PSAboot) R package)
